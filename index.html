	<h1>Odd 136</h1>

	<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Find 4 consecutive odd integers that add up to 136.</p>

	<h3>About the Program</h3>

	<p>There are many ways to use JavaScript to solve this, but I chose three methods that I think are the most efficient. All of them use arrays. The first method is the simplest. It iterates through the array and adds two. The second method takes advantage of the Shift array method. The third method sets each element in the array to the next element. (If you are confused, look at the <em>script.js</em>.)</p>

	<p>I also took the chance to extend the array object and touch the surface of JavaScript's prototypal orientation.</p>

	<h3>Instructions</h3>

	<p>To change the method used, comment out the line that calls the function. Then, remove the comment on the line that calls another function. If two or more functions are called, nothing will happen as only the first while loop will run.</p>
